OpenAPI standard will be used.

package to use: drf-spectacular for generating openapi 3 shcema

> pip install drf-spectacular
> add app
> register it within rest_framework config var
> add metadata to a new config var in settings.py for drf-spectacular
> to generate the shcema file as a standalone file, we can use the management command.
> python manage.py spectacular --file shcema.yml

a better approach is to serve a dynamic form of schema as a url route right in the project. this way it can be re-generated everytime api changes.
this could be added directly to project level urls.py

a documentation is more human friendly.
there are two tools supported by drf-spectacular to generate documentation, Redoc and SwaggerUI.

first Redoc:
in project level urls.py import SpectacularRedocView and add it to patterns

now SwaggerUI:
the process is the same, just import it in project level urls.py and add it to patterns
