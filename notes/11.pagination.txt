if using generic views or viewsets, pagination will be performed automatically.
there are different styles of pagination provided by drf:
LimitOffsetPagination, PageNumberPagination, StandardResultsSetPagination

> add the pagination config var to REST_FRAMEWORK config var in settings.py
> pagination can also be modified in view-level

> testing...
> works, now trying PageNumberPagination, works fine
- difference between these two is that LimitOffsetPagination uses the specified number of records to paginate the results.
if we choose page_size 3 in LimitOffsetPagination, the pages will be offset of 3, 6, 9 and ...

> PageNumberPagination is ok for our needs.
