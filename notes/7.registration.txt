we'll be using token based authentication. (other options are basic authentication and session authentication)

> add authentication config var to rest_framework var in settings.py:
add both session authentication and basic authentication
(so far, nothing has changed actually, since django uses both of these by default, we just added them explicitly)

why both?
because they serve different purposes. session authentication for the ability to login and logout
and basic for pass session id in http headers

> now, implementing token authentication
> update settings.py and replace basic with TokenAuthentication
> include a built in django app to generate tokens, authtoken to installed_apps
> run migrate (because installed_apps var has been modified)
> check admin interface to see if tokens has been added.
we will use two third party apps: dj-rest-auth, django-allauth

login and logout and password reset will come with dj-rest-auth package.
> pip install dj-rest-auth
> add to installed_apps
> update main urls.py to inlcude dj_rest_auth urls

> add django-allauth
> pip install django-allauth (the book version is 0.48.0, if install the latest version an error will be raised while trying to migrate)
- (go on with this older version for now, i will try to update it later)
> several new stuffs must be added to installed_apps
    • django.contrib.sites
    • allauth
    • allauth.account
    • allauth.socialaccount
    • dj_rest_auth.registration
> TEMPLATES config var needs to be updated. django-allauth added to it after context processor
> EMAIL_BACKEND must be added (to confirm email)
> SITE_ID also must be added (built-in sites frameworks requires this, we only have one site, so it's 1)
> migrate the database: python manage.py migrate
> add routes to main urls.py for registration
created account testuser1-hello123* (no email was provided)
creating a new one with email: testuser2 (raises error)
tried to change the order of installed_apps to match the book precisely.
raised error 'coudn't load manifest staticfiles.json''.
fixed it by removing the staticfiles folder entirely and running collectstatic command again.
attempting to register a new user with email.
stil get the same error: "AttributeError at /api/v1/dj-rest-auth/registration/
                        'EmailAddressManager' object has no attribute 'is_verified'"
can't process further, until this issue is resolved.
attempting to copy this project and change 'dedicated app folder' to normal, problem was not related to this.
uninstalled dj-rest-auth and django-allauth and re-installed latest versions of them.
added a middleware fo allauth.
needed to apply migrations
now email while sign up works, but confirming emails won't work. raises error ImproperlyConfigured error.

this section is considered finish. i will fix this issue later by using django-allauth alone or something else entirely.
