filtering is the process of selecting a certain subset of records from the entire queryset.

> i have been doing this all along, with returing only the contacts if logged in user

> the simplest way to achieve this, is to override the get_queryset method of generic views.

> adding filter (generic filtering) to browsable api
> add global filter backend to rest_framework config var
this can also be set in view-level

IMPORTANT: for some reason, drf is asking to install django-filter library (not at the beginning of the tutorial)

> pip install django-filter
> add to app
> (now add the backend globally or to class)
> add filterset_fields = ['category', 'in_stock'] to view for simple equality based filtering
> also add filter_backneds to view
this topic can be further discussed, but for now, this suffices
