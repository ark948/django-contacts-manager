permissions can be applied to different layers and levels (such as project level, view level, and model level)

project level permissions (host of configurations)
this is DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES in settings.py, rest_framework config var

right now it is set to AllowAny, we should update this

we will switch this to IsAuthenticated so only logged in or authenticated users can view the api.
> update settings.py
> turn on the server, logout and test the api view with a logged out user (done)
