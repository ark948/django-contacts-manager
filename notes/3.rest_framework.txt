rest api has three steps in process:
    urls.py for url routes
    serializers.py to transform data into JSON
    views.py to apply logic to each API endpoint

by default django has AllowAny permission to enable ease of use in local development

> pip install 
> add to installed_app
> add rest_framework config to settings.py
> udpate project urls.py to include api app urls (contacts.urls or apps.contacts.urls?) (ok, apps.contacts.urls works)
- contacts api will be added to contacts app itself
- we are doing this because contacts is our main functionality
- if we had multiple apis, we could add a dedicated api app and include are app's api into it (i'll do this later)
> add serializers.py to contacts.api
> add views
> bind views to url routes
