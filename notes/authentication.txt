- change name in apps.py from 'accounts' to 'apps.accounts'
> must be added to installed_apps (reconfiguration is needed in apps.py (stuff))
- 'apps.accounts.apps.AccountsConfig',
> define custom model in accounts/models.py
> add AUTH_USER_MODEL in settings.py (stuff is needed)
- AUTH_USER_MODEL = "accounts.CustomUser" (i was surprised here)
> make migrations without specifying app name (python manage.py makemigrations)
> run migrations (python manage.py migrate)
