viewsets and routers are an extra layer of abstraction to allow developers to write less code.
viewsets combine different views to a single class, and routers generate url endpoints automatically.

> add a user serializer to accounts/api/serializers.py (book put the code in posts app) in serializers.py
> add a viewset class that will inherit from viewset (import from rest_framework) in views.py
> in accounts/urls.py create a router.
> import and register the viewsets with router
> add the router.urls to urlpatterns variable
- note (app_name var was removed)
> also links in index page must be updated
