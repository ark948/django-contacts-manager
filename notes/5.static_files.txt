Django by itself does not server static files.
so they need to configured (compiled) and served in production by production server.

> create a static directory
> mkdir static
- since git does not keep track of empty folders, we should add a .keep file to static directory
> install whitenoise package
> pip install WhiteNoise
> udpate requirements.txt
- whitenoise needs to be added to three locations installed_apps (above staticfiles), whitenoise middleware above common middleware, and staticfiles_storage var
> update settings.py
> run compile command
> python manage.py collectstatic
