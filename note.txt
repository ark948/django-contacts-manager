- task 1: test first pages view to check connectivity (done)
- problem: don't remember much of django itself (i only read the beginner book)
- solution: i will develop the api first, and then read the django professional book and continue on.

task 2: add a dedicated app for user authentication and add a custom user model
- for this, it is imperative to not run migrations, before creating our own custom user model.
- refer to authentication.txt (done)

task 3: add contacts app
> mkdir apps/contacts
> python manage.py startapp contacts apps/contacts
- modify apps.py (name)
> add contact model

task 4: add rest api 
> pip install djangorestframework
> add it to installed_apps
> add rest_framework config var to settings.py
continue on rest framework note...
